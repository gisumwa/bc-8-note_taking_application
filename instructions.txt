Note taking application
Notes application has the following commands
createnote <note_content> - Create a note
viewnote <note_id> - View a single note
deletenote <note_id> - Delete a single note
listnotes - View a formatted list of all the notes taken
searchnotes <query_string> - View a formatted list of all the notes that can be identified by the query string
listnotes, searchnotes should have a --limit parameter for setting the number of items to display in the resulting list.
next should be invoked to see the next set of data in the current running query
Notes can be saved in memory but a database would be preferred (e.g SQLite or Postgres)
Create a syncnotes command for automatically synchronising notes with online datastore like Firebase or Parse (extra credit)
The Notes should be exportable and importable as CSV or JSON.
